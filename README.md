### Hi there, I'm Noah ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer interested in all sorts of things, currently working on [HonkyTonk](https://honkytonk.app/thebarn), a mobile-first web app designed to facilitate smooth interactions between DJs and bar-goers and collect meaningful data regarding song requests, written in TypeScript using React and Firebase.

Additionally, I'm currently learning to develop audio effect plugins using C++ and [Steinberg's VST3 SDK](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk). I'm also learning Rust because I think the crab looks cool (and to write a Linux driver for my mouse so that the scroll wheel might finally work, but that's secondary).  

I'm a hobbyist music [producer](https://soundcloud.com/skrooms), a competitive Rocket League [player](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/rocket-league/profile/epic/skrooms/overview) and coach, and was named TIME Magazine's 2006 Person of the Year.
If I'm not at my desk, you can find me at the gym, on an ultimate frisbee field, or on a dance floor, where I practice country swing with the hopes of one day competing and winning one of those stupid oversized belt buckles.
