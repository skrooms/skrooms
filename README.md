### Hi there, I'm Noah ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer interested in all sorts of things, currently working on [HonkyTonk](https://honkytonk.app/thebarn), a mobile-first web app designed to facilitate smooth interactions between DJs and bar-goers and collect meaningful data regarding song requests, written in TypeScript using React and Firebase.

Additionally, I'm currently learning to develop audio effect plugins using C++ and [Steinberg's VST3 SDK](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3sdk). I'm also learning Rust because I think the crab looks cool (and to write a Linux driver for my mouse so that the scroll wheel might finally work, but that's secondary).  

I'm a hobbyist music [producer](https://soundcloud.com/skrooms), a competitive Rocket League [player](https://rocketleague.tracker.network/rocket-league/profile/epic/skrooms/overview) and coach, and was named TIME Magazine's 2006 Person of the Year.
